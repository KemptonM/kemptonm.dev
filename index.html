        <h1>Hi, I'm Kempton.</h1>
        <p>
            I have a passion for programming, software development, and cybersecurity. In my free time, I read books and code.<br>I'm currently seeking internship opportunities in software engineering! If you think I'd be a good fit, please reach out at <a href="mailto:kempton.maillett@maine.edu">kempton.maillett@maine.edu</a>.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>University of Maine - Student Research Assistant</h3>
        <p>
            I contributed to the Scalable and Portable Infrastructure for Cybersecurity Education 
            project (SPICE). SPICE is a flexible, remotely accessible infrastructure that 
            leverages public cloud, data center, and portable computing resources. 
            It was developed to support a variety of cybersecurity education activities. 
            You can read more about the project <a href="https://umcst.maine.edu/spice.html">here.</a>

        <h4>Logging & monitoring</h4>
        <p>
            I worked closely with groupmates to implement centralized logging and monitoring 
            systems on Linux and Windows machines. For scalability, we used AWS to host virtual 
            machines running Wazuh, Elastic Stack, and Kibana for a web interface that displays 
            all kinds of logging/monitoring info. Finally, we wrote Ansible playbooks to automate 
            agent deployment.
        </p>
        <h4>Orginizational efforts</h4>
        <p>
            We met weekly over the 2021 summer to coordinate as a team, communicate 
            progress/challenges, and delegate different tasks. I primarily took notes during these 
            meetings and made clear the most urgent action items in our documentation.
        </p>
        <!--<h3>University of Maine - Student Tutor</h3>
        <p>I tutored two groups of five students in college level pre-calculus, organized meetings and facilitated group discussions.</p>-->

        <h2>Extracurricular</h2>
        <h3>University of Maine Cybersecurity Team</h3>
        <p>
            I joined UMCST in the spring of 2021. That summer, I got involved with the SPICE project to contribute to the team's infrastructure. Recently, I was elected Student Relations Officer and captained a team of three in the Hivestorm cybersecurity competition. I'm excited to lead our team's application security division for the 2022 Northeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (NECCDC). You can read more about UMCST <a href="https://umcst.maine.edu/">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Recruitment efforts</h4>
        <p>
            This 2021 fall semester our team saw record growth and attendance at our weekly introductory labs. We're looking forward to sending a full roster to NECCDC 2022!

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/KemptonM/KemptonM.github.io">This site</a></h3>
        <p>With HTML and CSS, I built this personal portfolio site to document my professional experience, software projects, and extracurricular activities. This site is hosted via GitHub pages, and changes automatically go live as I push with git.</p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/KemptonM/Terrain-Generator">Terrain map generator</a></h3>
        <p>
            For a Python programming course at UMaine, we were given a Python file that would generate a matrix which contained related elevation values in each cell. I used tkinter to generate a terrain overlay based on those given elevation values. I implemented an ocean level, a gradient grass color, rivers that flow recursively downhill, and beaches where grass and ocean meet.
