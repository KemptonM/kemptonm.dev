            I have a passion for programming, software development, and cybersecurity. In my free time, I read books and code.<br>I'm currently seeking internship opportunities in software engineering! If you think I'd be a good fit, please reach out at <a href="mailto:kempton.maillett@maine.edu">kempton.maillett@maine.edu</a>.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>University of Maine - Student Research Assistant</h3>
        <p>
            I contributed to the Scalable and Portable Infrastructure for Cybersecurity Education project (SPICE). <q>SPICE is a flexible, remotely accessible infrastructure that leverages public cloud, data center, and portable computing resources. It was developed to support a variety of cybersecurity education activities.</q>
        </p>
        <h4>SIEM systems</h4>
        <p>
            I worked closely with groupmates to implement centralized logging and monitoring systems on Linux and Windows machines. For easy scaling, we used AWS to host virtual machines running Wazuh, Elastic Stack, and Kibana for a web interface. We wrote Ansible playbooks to automate agent deployment.
        </p>
        <h4>Orginizational efforts</h4>
        <p>
            We met weekly over the 2021 summer to coordinate as a team, communicate progress/challenges, and delegate different tasks. I primarily took notes during these meetings and made clear the most urgent action items in our documentation.
        </p>
        <h3>University of Maine - Student Tutor</h3>
        <p>I tutored two groups of five students in college level pre-calculus, organized meetings and facilitated group discussions.</p>
